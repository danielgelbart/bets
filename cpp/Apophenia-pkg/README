Apophenia is an open statistical library for working with data sets and statistical or simulation models. It provides functions on the same level as those of the typical stats package (such as OLS, probit, or singular value decomposition) but gives the user more flexibility to be creative in model-building. Being in C, it is often an order of magnitude faster when searching for optima or running MCMC chains. The core functions are written in C, but experience has shown them to be easy to bind to Python/Julia/Perl/Ruby/&c.

http://apophenia.info/gentle.html provides an overview of the basics of using the library. If you want to know more about the package, see the web site, http://apophenia.info, or have a look at the textbook from Princeton University Press that coevolved with Apophenia, downloadable from http://modelingwithdata.org .


Installation summary:

∙ The library depends on the GNU Scientific Library and SQLite3. If you are using a system with a package manager of some sort, there is certainly a package for them. Be sure to include both the main package and the lib-, -dev, or -devel package. Sample package manager calls:

    sudo apt-get install make gcc libgsl0-dev libsqlite3-dev 
or
    sudo yum install make gcc gsl-devel libsqlite3x-devel
or
    sudo pacman -S make gcc gsl sqlite 


∙ Got the dependencies? Great, then run:

    ./configure
    make 
    sudo make install

Thanks for your interest. I do hope that Apophenia helps you learn more from your data.
